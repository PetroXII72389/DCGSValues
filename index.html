        <p>
          DCGS or "Dr Challoner's Grammar School" is an excellent school in Amersham in South-East England. Here we motivate students to take an interest in their own education and emphasize key values. Our main values are made clear in our motte "Excellence with Integrity" as the two values that the school promotes above all others are excellence as integrity. This is because without excellence their is no success; without integrity excellence is worthless. As well as this we also promote interactional skills such as empathy and kindness such that our students develop into empathetic and kind young men. We guarentee that all students leaving Challoners pride themselves on their kindness and academic excellence.<br><br> We also stand out for exceptional results in GCSEs and A-Levels that are some of the greatest in the entire country. This is as a result of excellent staff who truly care about their students and students that value their own education.
